# CarTrax Database Configuration
# This file is used to configure the database connection for the CarTrax application.
# It supports multiple environments: development, test, and production.
# The configuration uses PostgreSQL as the database adapter and allows for environment-specific settings.

  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # Use the database name from the environment variable, or default to 'cartrax'

development:

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: cartrax_test


# Store production database in the storage/ directory, which by default
# is mounted as a persistent Docker volume in config/deploy.yml.
production:
  <<: *default
  database: cartrax_production
  # Ensure the production database is not stored in the same place as development/test
  # This is important for security and data integrity.
